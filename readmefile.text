1) The differences between   getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector/querySelectorAll are given below:

getElementById(id): Selects a single element by its unique id attribute.

getElementsByClassName(className): Selects multiple elements by their class name.

querySelector(selector): Selects the first element that matches a specified CSS selector (example:#id, .class).

querySelectorAll(selector): Selects all elements that match a specified CSS selector.



2) To create and insert a new element into the DOM we use 
document.createElement()


3)Event bubbling is when an event on an element (like a click) spreads upwards to its parent elements, all the way to the top of the page.


4)Event Delegation in JavaScript means attaching a single event listener to a parent element instead of adding listeners to each child element.


5)preventDefault():Stops the default browser behavior for an element.
stopPropagation():Stops the event from bubbling to parentÂ elements.
